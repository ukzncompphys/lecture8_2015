Final projects: either make an nobdy simulator that runs in n*log(n)
time, or a 2nd order accurate 2-d hydro code.  Either post on github
or send me your codes, along with instructions on how to run the test
cases listed below.  Please add comments to you code so I can
understand what it's doing!  Still waiting for official OK from
university on dates.  Assuming that's OK, a draft is due on May 26th,
with the final version due on the 20th of June.

2015 note - these dates will be updated, but should be approximately OK.

nbody:  make a 2-D nbody code that calculates the forces by computing
the potential, where the potential is found by convolving the density
with the (softened) potential from a single particle.  Show that a
single particle at rest remains motionless.  Second, show that a pair
of particles placed in a circular orbit continue to orbit each other.
Third, set up both periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions.  Set
up a problem where hundreds of thousands of particles are initially
scattered randomly throughout the domain.  Show the evolution with
time for both periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions.  Track
the total energy - how well is it conserved?  NOTE - you *must* use
FFTs on a grid to get full marks for this project.  If you instead
just do what we did in class and calculate the pair-wise forces on
particles, you will do very poorly.


hydro:  make a 2-D 2nd order accurate dimenstionally split hydro code.
To do this, you'll need to worry about the Riemann problem on the cell
interfaces, Mike Zingale's hydro notes can walk you through this:

Set up the Zod shock tube problem with over half the array, and plot
the solution as a function of time.  Set up a "bullet" - a gaussian
blob of high-density matter moving quickly, and show its evolution
over time with periodic boundary conditions.  Do this for both a
super- and sub-sonic bullet.  Finally, set up 2 bullets and shoot them
into each other.  What does this look like?
